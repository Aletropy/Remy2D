# Remy

**Remy** is an simple OpenGL graphical library, it supports to rendering multiple 2D objects. In future may be added a physics engine to it.

## How to Use?

If you want to know how to install, build, or just use it, I'll refer to all of this on the [Wiki](https://github.com/Aletropy/Remy2D/wiki/Home) page.

## Why?

I'm doing this because I want to learn all the concepts of OpenGL, and some of them to create a game engine. It is not made to replace any existing library; instead, it is primarily made for me to do my own stuff with it.

## Why OpenGL? And not Vulkan?

I'd prefer to use OpenGL because I'm more familiar with it, just for a while. I'm planning to move to Vulkan in the future.
