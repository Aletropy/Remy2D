# Remy

**Remy** is an simple OpenGL graphical library, it supports to rendering multiple 2D objects. In future may be added a physics engine to it.

## How to Use?

If you want to know how to install, build or just use it, i'll refer all this in the *Wiki* page.

## Why?

Im making this because i want to learn all concepts of OpenGL, and some of them to make an game engine. It is not made to replace any existing library, otherwise is primary made to i do my own stuff with it.

## Why OpenGL? And not Vulkan?

I'd prefer to use OpenGL because im more friendly with it, just for while. Im planning to move to vulkan in future.
